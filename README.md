# To Do App with Riverpod

This project is a to do app. I used this project to learn Riverpod.
It saves your data locally on your device with hive. This means
the data stored save. Also the App does not collect any kind of user 
data.

## How to install
Go to the Releases and install the app.apk file on your device.
Your phone will show you everything after your click on the 
app.apk file.
